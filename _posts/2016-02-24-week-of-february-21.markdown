There still have been no responses to the surveys we sent out, therefore we are moving forward without them. This week I will be working on making diagrams for how the site will work. I will also work on the layout of the site, and edit the current logo iteration, trying to make it clearer.

I will also be working on making information for sheets on the site, such as measurements for spec sheets and what they should look like for different garments.

Due to worries about money being a restrictive factor, there is an active search for grants.
