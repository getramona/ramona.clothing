This week data modeling for the database was completed. I was able to generate [a new entity relationship diagram](https://github.com/getramona/ramona/blob/4268db111b0322f834c995248b4b5c1a65e17b4b/erd.pdf) to show the final set up of the database. I've also started creating access policies to ensure only certain people have access to certain objects.
