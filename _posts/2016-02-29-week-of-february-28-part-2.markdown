This is how the site will basically function and how the pages will interact with each other. M stands for multiple and O stands for one meaning for example, an Organization can have multiple calendars but a Calendar can only belong to one organization.

Garments will also have attributes such as stage of development and if a garment has been approved at whatever stage.
