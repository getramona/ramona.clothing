    <p>What we have been working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusting logo</li>
  <li>Website Layout wire-frames</li>
  <li>Creating business plan</li>
  <li>Mock up marketing campaign</li>
  <li>Creating presentation</li>
  <li>Website functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>We are have been busy the past month, which is a reason we have been slow to update our journals. With just a few weeks until we officially show our product to the world we are working to create the best possible site and future for this product.</p>

<p>Here are some images of what we have been working on:</p>

    <p>This week data modeling for the database was completed. I was able to generate <a href="https://github.com/getramona/ramona/blob/4268db111b0322f834c995248b4b5c1a65e17b4b/erd.pdf">a new entity relationship diagram</a> to show the final set up of the database. I’ve also started creating access policies to ensure only certain people have access to certain objects.</p>

<p>This is how the site will basically function and how the pages will interact with each other. M stands for multiple and O stands for one meaning for example, an Organization can have multiple calendars but a Calendar can only belong to one organization.</p>

<p>Garments will also have attributes such as stage of development and if a garment has been approved at whatever stage.</p>

This another version of the logo which has been simplified with a larger face.</p>

    <p>This week was one of more development. Points of measure are ready for when the spec sheet forms are created online. There has been page layout development as well as an overall structure of the site.</p>

<p>On the development side, more work was done with data modeling, access control, and with application-specific business logic.</p>

<p>Part 2 will have images for progress.</p>

    <p>There still have been no responses to the surveys we sent out, therefore we are moving forward without them. This week I will be working on making diagrams for how the site will work. I will also work on the layout of the site, and edit the current logo iteration, trying to make it clearer.</p>

<p>I will also be working on making information for sheets on the site, such as measurements for spec sheets and what they should look like for different garments.</p>

<p>Due to worries about money being a restrictive factor, there is an active search for grants.</p>
