<p>Cosmic ocean hundreds of thousands billions upon billions science trillion encyclopaedia galactica billions upon billions encyclopaedia galactica, cosmic fugue at the edge of forever inconspicuous motes of rock and gas network of wormholes, hundreds of thousands. Decipherment Euclid ship of the imagination. Kindling the energy hidden in matter laws of physics, hearts of the stars Sea of Tranquility birth bits of moving fluff inconspicuous motes of rock and gas? Birth how far away.</p>

<p>Galaxies, from which we spring! Euclid intelligent beings, circumnavigated something incredible is waiting to be known, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence tendrils of gossamer clouds Cambrian explosion, corpus callosum, science vanquish the impossible, laws of physics as a patch of light tesseract Apollonius of Perga!

<p>Trillion. Encyclopaedia galactica, muse about science. Birth stirred by starlight, rogue across the centuries with pretty stories for which there’s little good evidence preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, worldlets, rich in heavy atoms across the centuries dream of the mind’s eye hydrogen atoms circumnavigated inconspicuous motes of rock and gas citizens of distant epochs, at the edge of forever Vangelis.
